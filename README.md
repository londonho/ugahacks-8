TrashTalk is an app and website that will help our users understand what can be recycled. Through TrashTalk, users will be able to access our barcode scanner and other search methods. Users can scan the barcode on a product and TrashTalk will retrieve information about the product and its recyclability status. While this is not yet fully implemented, TrashTalk can currently retrieve information about the name, packaging material, and recyclability of a product when users input the barcode number. The app will be able to provide information on recycling instructions and facilities near the user's location. The purpose of the app is to promote sustainability and help the community to reduce waste by encouraging the proper recycling of products.
